				<p>Welcome to the FBC website! We are a church with a morning congregation of about eighty, serving a community of around four thousand people. Ferring has kept its unique village identity despite its healthy size and its connections to nearby Worthing. More than half the population are retired, but many are still very energetic in their local involvement, and the age profile and vitality of our church reflect these factors. Situated in Greystoke Road, we are just round the corner from Church Lane and St. Andrew's C. of E. with whom we work closely as we seek to represent Christ in Ferring.</p>
								
				<p>Our life at FBC is founded on the scriptures and the saving work of Jesus Christ, and our aim is to make Jesus and his love the focus of everything we do. Our worship blends older and newer styles in a way that seeks to be encouraging, positive, and accessible to people of different traditions and backgrounds. The 10:30 A.M. service is definitely the larger of the two, with the 6:30 P.M. worship attractive to some because of its more intimate atmosphere. Communion is normally celebrated on the first Sunday evening and the third Sunday morning of the month. Any Christian is welcome to share in communion, and the wine used is non-alcoholic. We are pastored by Rev. Stuart Robinson, who has ministered here since 1990 and rejoices at the positive developments the Lord has brought to the church during that time.</p>
