				<h1>Women's Fellowship</h1>
								
				<img src="images/visitors_tea.jpg" alt="tea" class="teapic" width="200" height="150" />
								
				<p>This <strong>meets on Tuesdays at 2:30 p.m.</strong> during most of the year and is well attended (about twenty ladies at present). After a relaxing chat over a cup of tea there is a short time of worship followed by a Christian message given by a local speaker. <strong>The quality of the talks and the warmth of fellowship are usually very special</strong>. Particular events at certain times of year (such as the visit of children from the local school to sing carols at Christmas) are very much enjoyed. In summer months when weather permits some members open their gardens for the meeting to take place outdoors.
