				<p>Every fortnight a group called &quot;Dabblers&quot; meets from <strong>2:00 p.m. until 4:00 p.m. on a Thursday to which people bring their favourite hobbies and crafts</strong> and do them together. Again, this is a relaxed occasion to which neighbours and friends can easily be invited.</p>

<p>We are happy to <strong>host a Women's Breakfast every three months</strong> where women of the village can meet and share fellowship together. A speaker also shares her experience of faith in Jesus. This breakfast is led by a team of women from six churches both in Ferring and the surrounding area.</p><br />
