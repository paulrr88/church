				<p><strong>Under 18's are very welcome</strong> to share in worship on any Sunday, but we also cater for children and young people on Friday evenings in term-time. Friday Club has two sessions, one at 4:45 p.m. for ages 4-7 and the other at 6:00 p.m. for ages 8-11 and 11-14. Each session lasts an hour, and includes games and crafts, plus a Bible-based story, discussion, or film. <strong>All staff are trained in &quot;Safe to Grow&quot; procedures</strong> (the Baptist Union's guidelines for the protection of children and those who work with them) and <strong>all adults in regular contact with children have obtained the criminal record disclosures</strong> that are a legal requirement.</p>

				<p>In the summer holidays, <strong>we run a one week <a href="holidayclub.php">Holiday Bible Club</a> for children</strong> which is very popular in the village - especially with parents!</p><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
