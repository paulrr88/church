				<p><strong>Under 18's are very welcome</strong> to share in worship on any Sunday, but we also cater for children and young people on Friday evenings in term-time. <strong>Friday Club runs from 5:00-6:00 p.m. every week (except during half-terms). 4-7 year-olds can join us for Minis, and we have a Juniors session for 8-11s</strong>. The sessions run at the same time, and include games and crafts, plus a Bible-based story, discussion, or film.</p>

<p></p>
                    
                    <p>All staff are trained in "Safe to Grow" procedures (the Baptist Union's guidelines for the protection of children and those who work with them) and all adult leaders have obtained the criminal record disclosures that are a legal requirement.</p>
                    

				<p>In the summer holidays, <strong>we run a one week <a href="holidayclub.php">Holiday Bible Club</a> for children</strong> which is very popular in the village - especially with parents!</p><br /><br /><br /><br /></div>
