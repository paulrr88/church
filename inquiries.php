				<h2>About hall hire</h2>
				
				<p>We unfortunately do not have a hall that is separated from the rest of the church. This means that, for reasons of insurance, <strong>we are not able to rent out our hall</strong>.

				<p>However, <strong>you can try the Glebelands Centre, which is next door to us</strong>. They can be contacted on <strong>01903 700539</strong> or emailed at <strong>info@gcentre.co.uk</strong>.</p>
