				<h2>About hall hire</h2>

				<p>We unfortunately do not have a hall that is separated from the rest of the church. This means that, for reasons of insurance, <strong>we are not able to rent out our hall</strong>.

				<p>However, <strong>St. Andrew's Church does have a church hall that can be booked</strong>, please <a href="http://www.standrewsferring.org.uk/contacts.html"><strong>get in contact at their website</strong></a>. There's also <strong>the Glebelands Centre, which is next door to us</strong>. They can be contacted on <strong>01903 700539</strong>.</p>
